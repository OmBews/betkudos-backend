Our current database schema is:

users:

- id
- username
- ...etc

crypto_currencies:

- id
- ticker (BTC, USDT)
- icon
- max_bet (We can set the max bet/min bet/max profit per crypto)
- min_bet
- max_bet_profit
- places (decimal places)

wallets: (User wallets)

A user could have multiple wallets over different cryptocurrencies

- user_id (The user that owns)
- crypto_currency_id
- balance

The balance column represents the sum of all the balance available over all
wallet addresses, so if the use did 2 deposits of 0.5 BTC over 2 different BTC addresses
their balance on the BTC wallet should be 1 BTC.

-----------------------------------------------------------
